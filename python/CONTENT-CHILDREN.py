'''Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
Example 2:

Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.


Constraints:

1 <= g.length <= 3 * 104
0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104
1 <= g[i], s[j] <= 231 - 1'''
